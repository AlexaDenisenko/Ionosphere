Prediction of foF2 - critical frequency
Welcome to my GitHub page focused on ionospheric foF2 critical frequency prediction. The Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model is utilised to forecast foF2 up to 24 hours ahead, prioritising mid and high latitudes. Covering the 24th solar cycle (2008-2019), the LSTM model captures intricate temporal dependencies. This aids in understanding and predicting ionospheric behaviour, which is vital for fields like communications and space weather forecasting.

The LSTM model's efficacy is compared with Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Multilayer Perceptron algorithms, offering a comprehensive performance evaluation. Explore this work, join us in unravelling ionospheric dynamics, and contribute to predictive insights in this captivating realm.
